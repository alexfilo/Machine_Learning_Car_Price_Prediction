# Machine_Learning_Car_Price_Prediction
* Predicted the price of used cars posted on Ebay
* Used multiple ML techniques: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM
* Optimized hyperparameters using grid search cross validation
* Compared model performances to see which best predicted the car price according to MSE
* Calculated feature importances to see which car features are most important in determining price
* Created a pipeline to perform One Hot Encoding and Scaling
